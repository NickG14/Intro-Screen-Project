These songs are fully copyrighted, but if you use these songs for non-commercial purposes then I am unlikely to stop you, as long as you credit me. Non-commercial in this case means “not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.” Please email me at boomkittymusic@gmail.com to discuss using one of these tracks commercially. 

Basically I want to protect myself legally and make sure I have the option to prevent a bad actor from using these songs, but I also want people to be able to use them in their YouTube videos and such. So go ahead and use these songs for your videos and other non-commercial purposes, but understand that I retain the right to stop someone from using them for any reason at any time. So far this has never happened.
